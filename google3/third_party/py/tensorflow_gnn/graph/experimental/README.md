The directory tree under `tensorflow_gnn/graph/experimental`
holds experimental extensions to `tensorflow_gnn/graph`,
each in a separate subdirectory.

This is a testing ground. There are **no guarantees** for experimental code.
It may change, break or disappear at any time for any reason -- or migrate to a
non-experimental part of the library.
