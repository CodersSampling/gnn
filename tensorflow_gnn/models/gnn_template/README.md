# A GNN Template for other models

## Overview

This directory contains configurable code for building a variety of GNN models,
with key pieces to be defined by the user.

TensorFlow programs can import it as

```python
from tensorflow_gnn.models import gnn_template
```

## Maintenance and stability

This code is experimental, with no promises of API stability.
It is maintained by the TF-GNN team along the core library.
